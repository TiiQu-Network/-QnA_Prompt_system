# Keywords approach 

- This approach takes into accounts the pre-defined keywords to see if they can help predict the labels. The results were not good as the pre-defined keywords did not help predict the labels

# Cluster approach 

- This approach used k-means clustering. The clusters were then used to predict if they could help predict the labels by comparing it with pre-defined labels.
- This approach limitation was that science and tech words were overlapping into other clusters.
- This approach did not produce adequate results aswell.
